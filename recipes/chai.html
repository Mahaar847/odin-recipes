            <h2>HOW TO MAKE AUTHENTIC PAKISTANI CHAI (DOODH PATTI)</h2>
            Making chai is incredibly simple and quite forgiving. To make it, you simply:<br>
            
            Bring the water to a boil and add the tea and cardamom pods. Allow this to simmer.<br>
            Add milk and let it come to a boil. Continue to boil, removing from heat as needed or simmer to desired strength.<br>If desired, use a ladle to aerate the chai.<br>
            Pour into cups and sweeten as desired.<br>
            <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
            
 1 1/4 cup water<br>
1 cup* whole milk or 2% reduced-fat milk, whole milk will result in a slightly richer, creamier chai<br>
1 1/2 tsp (or 2 black teabags) loose tea-leaves (I use Tapal Danedar or Ahmad Tea), or more to taste<br> 
1-2 cardamom pods, slightly broken or a pinch of cardamom powder (optional)<br>
sweetener, to taste
            
<h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2> 
Place water in a saucepan over high heat. Once it comes to a boil, add tea-leaves or tea bag and cardamom.<br>Reduce the heat to medium and gently allow this to simmer for a minute or two.<br>
Add the milk and raise the heat back to high (or allow the milk to come to a simmer on its own).<br>
As it begins to boil, the chai will rise in the saucepan. Remove the pan from heat before it reaches the top of the saucepan.<br>Do this a few times to really develop the flavor while using a ladle to scoop and pour back the chai.<br>Alternately, once it comes to a boil, lower the heat and allow it to simmer to desired strength (~3-5 minutes).<br>
Pour this chai through a small sieve into your favorite cups and sweeten using sugar or honey.<br>
<h3>NOTES</h3>
*Feel free to reduce the amount of milk and increase the water if you prefer thinner, less milky chai.
