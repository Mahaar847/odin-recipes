            <h1>How to make homemade dal</h1>
Prep your lentils. Start by rinsing your lentils a few times until the water runs clear.<br> Then cover them with fresh water and soak them for about 30 minutes to an hour.<br>
Sauté the onions.<br> Next you’ll want to sauté the onions in olive oil for a few minutes until they’re tender. Add in the ginger and garlic and cook until slightly browned.
Add spices.<br> Stir in all of those cozy spices and cook everything for a few minutes until it darkens and smells aromatic.<br>
Add tomatoes. <br>Stir in the tomato paste and cook it for a couple of minutes, then pour in the crushed tomatoes and cook for a few minutes to reduce.<br>
Pour in the broth.<br> Next, add the coconut milk and vegetable broth and simmer everything for about 5 minutes.<br>
Cook the lentils.<br> Add your drained lentils to the pot and simmer for about 30 minutes until they’re soft and the curry is nice and thick. Stir in spinach until it wilts.<br>
Thicken & serve.<br> Add the fresh lemon juice and stir for about 10 minutes until the dal thickens to your liking. Then serve!<br>
